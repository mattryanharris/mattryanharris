### Hi there 👋

I currently work at 🚀 NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory working on 🛰 [Europa Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Clipper) as a software engineer and just finished my bachelors degree at 🐴 California Polytechnic University Pomona. 

I've previously interned at Apple, Naval Air Systems Command, and Naval Sea Systems Command.  I enjoy hiking, watching Tik Tok, and vibing.  Other things to note: I graduate this December and I'm currently am looking for full-time work.
